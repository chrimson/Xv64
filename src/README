Assumes very basic Linux operation, like installing Ubuntu, copying files to working directory and editing files.

Unzipped project may still need to change permissions of Perl scripts:
chmod u+x sign.pl vectors32.pl vectors64.pl

QEMU, GCC and MAKE also need to be installed. 
 

---- PART I. 32-bit xv6 ----

1. On Ubuntu 20.04 64-bit environment with 2 CPUs, verify that platform is 64-bit with x86_64
uname -a

2. In decompressed directory with C and assembly code files, open Makefile. In the first two lines, ensure that OS = 32 and QA = 32. Save and close Makefile

3. Start from clean sandbox, run QEMU
make clean
make qemu

4. Test basic OS commands
ls
echo Hello xv6!
cat README
mkdir sub
ls
cd sub
../ls
../echo Hello CYSE 570! > file1.txt
../echo Goodbye > file2.txt
../cat file1.txt file2.txt > file3.txt
../cat file3.txt
../ls ..
../grep README ../README
<ctrl-a> c q <enter>

5. Edit first two lines in Makefile so that OS = 32 and QA = 64

6. Run the same OS on 64-bit QEMU architecture
make qemu

7. Test with similar commands as step 4


--- PART II. 64-bit xv6 ---

8. Set OS = 64 and QA = 64

9. Clean previous compile. Compile incrementally and run
make clean
make bootblock
make kernel
make xv6.img
make fs.img
make qemu

10. Test

11. Try OS = 64, QA = 32

12. Try to run QEMU


--- PART III. 64-bit xv6 on 32-bit hardware ---

13. On Ubuntu 16.04 32-bit environment with 2 CPUs, verify that platform is 32-bit with i686
uname -a

14. OS = 64, QA = 64

15. Clean, run
make clean
make qemu

16. Test
ls
echo 64-bit emulator > file1.txt
echo 32-bit hardware > file2.txt
echo CYSE570 rocks 64 times! > file3.txt
cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt > file4.txt
cat file4.txt
<ctrl-a> c q <enter>

17. Try OS = 64, QA = 32

18. Try to run QEMU
